8) we will get two errors:

The error you're seeing:

```
Module not found: Can't resolve '@headlessui/react'
```

means that the dependency `@headlessui/react` is **not installed**, but it is being **imported and used** in your code (likely in `Navigation.jsx`).

---

### âœ… Fix: Install the Missing Package

Run this command in your project root:

```bash
npm install @headlessui/react
```

This will install the required package.

After it's installed, try running the app again:

```bash
npm start
```

---

### ðŸ§  Why This Happens

* `@headlessui/react` is a library used with Tailwind CSS for accessible UI components like modals, dropdowns, and more.
* It must be explicitly installed if your component relies on it.

Let me know if you also need to install `@heroicons/react` (often used with `@headlessui/react`). If yes, run:

```bash
npm install @heroicons/react
```

The new error:

```
Module not found: Can't resolve '@heroicons/react/24/outline'
```

means that the **Heroicons** package is not installed in your project, and you're trying to use icons like this in `Navigation.jsx`:

```js
import { Bars3Icon, XMarkIcon } from '@heroicons/react/24/outline'
```

---

### âœ… Fix: Install `@heroicons/react`

Run this command in your project root:

```bash
npm install @heroicons/react
```

Once it's done, run your app again:

```bash
npm start
```

---

### ðŸ“¦ What Is `@heroicons/react`?

It provides free, beautifully designed SVG icons from the Tailwind CSS team. The path `/24/outline` refers to the 24-pixel outline style icons.
